This directory contains packages that are being tested or need special 
consideration before they can be merged to base/extra. 

Some of these packages have additional dependencies that are not in 
the repo yet. You may find the dependencies on SlackBuilds Project (SBo).  
Dependencies  will be noted in a README on each package and may be added 
here as time permits.

More packages may be added here over time.  The mate-build-testing.sh script 
is provided as a convenience but since all the dependencies might not be in 
the msb repo yet, the script may or may not work.  Essentially, /testing is 
just that -- testing and the user may need to take additional steps to get 
these packages to build and install.

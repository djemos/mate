MATE 1.8 to 1.10 Upgrade HOWTO
<mateslackbuilds@gmail.com>

This document explains how to upgrade from MATE 1.8 to MATE 1.10 on
Slackware Linux 14.1.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before you begin, we strongly recommend making a backup of your system, or,
if not the entire system, at least the /etc and your home directory.  You
might find that you need to refer to a few things after the upgrade process
is complete. Back it up, or take your chances.

OK, now that everything is safely backed up, let's proceed. :-)

You will need the MATE 1.10 packages available on your local system.  Grab
them from the official repository at http://www.slackware.org.uk/msb/ or
any of the mirror sites.  Due to the fact that MATE 1.10 has new and obsoleted
packages, we do not recommend upgrading using slackpkg+ or other similar
utilities.

0.  Log out from the MATE desktop.

1.  Upgrade and install all new MATE 1.10 packages:

    upgradepkg --install-new --reinstall /path/to/deps/*.txz
    upgradepkg --install-new --reinstall /path/to/base/*.txz
    upgradepkg --install-new --reinstall /path/to/extra/*.txz

2.  Remove obsolete packages:

    removepkg mate-calc
    removepkg mate-dialogs

3.  Run xwmconfig and select xinitrc.mate-session. This ensures you get the
    latest copy of xinitrc.mate-session due to changes in mate-session-
    manager.  ALWAYS run this command for both new installations or upgrades
    from MATE 1.8

At this point you should be running MATE 1.10 on Slackware 14.1.  :-)  If
you have installed everything from /base and /extra (which will include
packages from the /deps directory) then you should have a total of 67
packages:

    $ ls /var/log/packages | grep _msb | wc -l
      66

We wish everyone good luck with this!  Please report any issues to

The following is a list of notes on building MATE on Slackware -current:

Since current is now using newer GTK+3 version than what we have in 14.1
and MATE developers support different GTK+3 version, you can simply run this
command to build mate-themes designed to be compatible for specific GTK+3:
GTKVERSION=gtk3.14 sh mate-themes.SlackBuild
You can replace 3.14 with any GTK+3 version you are using on your machine.

Thanks to Ryan P.C. McQuen for the reminder.

Pat has rebuilt xdg-utils in Slackware 14.1 to properly support MATE DE, so
xdg-utils patch is no longer needed in Slackware -current, but running
these two commands as normal user are still needed to set caja as the
default handler:

xdg-mime default caja-folder-handler.desktop inode/directory
xdg-mime default caja-folder-handler.desktop application/x-directory

please make a backup of your $HOME/.local/share/applications/defaults.list
before executing the above commands
